Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created 5 html files for the pages I would need for my food delivery website. One html file was our restaurant homepage.
Another was ordering, the other is menu, about us, and then miscellaneous.
I also created some CSS aspects to my website design, making the website look pleasing.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not incorporated the javascript functions where we ask the user for their order, time, distance, and etc. So now we need to add those so we can output final price and delivery time.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We had problems with storing the food items into a data file, choosing either csv or sql database.
Many times, we thought about changing the idea of our project. Whether it should be creating your own restaurant and inputting food items or not.
