# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Gimme Food

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that will calculate the final price of food order and delivery.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We will create our own restaruant with our food options, prices, location, times, peak hours, and etc.
The website will prompt the user to order the food that they want and quanity.
The website will prompt for their distance from our location.
The website will prompt for the tip.
The website will calculate the total delivery time, given the time of day, the amount of traffic, and how busy the restaurant is
We will make up our own information on this with our own formula.
In the end, the website will display the final price including tip, tax, and delivery fee and estimated time of delivery.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, we will make a website that will take in an input for food orders and output the price.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is to incorporate more of the ways the website can prompt the user and calculate the final price and estimate the delivery time.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is to make the website look appealing, simple, and easy to use. I hope that we can make the website output and accurate price and time delivery.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will learn how to better use javascript and how it differs from C. I am working with a partner.
I will focus on the Javascript portion, and making sure the webiste will take the correct input and output. I will collobarate on the HTML portion, making sure it is correct and lines up with my javascript code.
