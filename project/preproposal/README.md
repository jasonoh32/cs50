# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

We will be creating a command line program using C that will in the end output a final price and estimated time
for food delivery.
The input would be the program name and the csv file of restaurant menu
The csv file will contain a table with all the options with their prices
The program will print out options for entrees, drinks, sides, dessert, etc from the csv file chosen by user
The program will prompt for what the user wants to order and the quantity
The program will prompt for distance from restaurant and time of day to calculate delivery fee
The program will prompt for percentage tip
The program will output final price including tax and estimated arrival time
Price is dependent on orders, amount of orders, tip, distance, traffic, and how busy the restaurant is
Arrival time is dependent on time to complete the order, distance, traffic, and how busy the restaurant is
